Ray Tracing In One Weekend
========

An Implementation of RayTracingInOneWeekend in Java (https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

This is bascially a finger excercise and not optimized at all. It is a rough implementation of the examples from the tutorial.

Comments are in German - yeah, shoot me!
